The implementation of server and client side code has been done in 2 different python scripts which use a number of libraries and related function to implement features such as concurrent access, file locking, threading etc.


(FIRST)
RUN SERVER -
	python3 my_Server.py
	
(NEXT)
RUN CLIENT(s) - 
	python3 my_Client.py

	
The server manages the library data and handles client requests. It listens for connections on port 9999 and provides the following functionalities:

ADMIN ONLY - 

add_book : Add a new book to the library
